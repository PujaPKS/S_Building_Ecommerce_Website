Task details

Right now you have been able to design a cart component which uses hardCoded CartElement.

Deliverables

We want to able to make the Add to cart button work , somehow.
The cartIcon should show the number of items in the cart , just like this app - https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/dynamicstore.html




Steps - Pretty Simple



We would be using the Context API to solve this
Imagine if you can read the cartElement from the context API instead of using hardCoded CartElement.
When the user adds to Cart , add the element in the store or increase the quantity if the element already exists.
The cartIcon should show the number of items in the cart
