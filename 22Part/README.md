Previously you had built an Ecommerce website.

Deliverable

Add a login page tab on the top, next to the About tabs. Whenever the user clicks on it he gets redirected to login tab
Use firebase Authentication Api as you have used previously.
There is no need to build signup page as such.
Whenever the user successfully logs In , redirect him to the products page- so that he can see all the products and also store the bearer token in context and localstorage for future use like before
Show an error message if the login fails , like the way you had done previously
