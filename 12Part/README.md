Problem

The Ecommerce site which you had built lagged a Contact US page.

Customers that face any issues , should be able to report that to you.



Useful Resouces

React Router is the most widely used package in react js.

No project is built without it.

To understand what problem it solves watch videos 1 to 6 from the following link(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17stgiIV6SSKZ-EL9UxKS_HGMWLqrH12S) and implement the following.



WARNING!!!!

We are going to use the old react router v5 version.

V6 version is fairly new and not a lot of companies have not migrated.





Deliverable

1. Add a separate Navigator on the top , next to About button
2. When user clicks on it , take him to the contact US page
3. In the Contact Us page, show the User a form which takes the following inputs -> Name, email Id, phone number of the user .
4. When the user clicks on submit store the data into firebase db by doing a POST request.
